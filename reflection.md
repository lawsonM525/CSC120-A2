I have *seemingly* successfully created a class for the resale shop by referencing the procedural resale shop file. I wanted to start with creating a class for the computers first but I'm still not sure what exactly to reference for the attributes and methods for a computer. I'm thinking of referencing the functions in main.py especially the create_computer function as that has possible attributes. However, I would also need some methods for the computers and I'm not sure which ones to use yet.

My partner and I just realized hat not all the functions in `procedural_resale_shop.py` are meant to be put in the resale shop class. We sorted out the different methods from Step 2 of the Task Description.
*Note to hypothetical future student: READ THE README!*

I met with my whole study group later on and we made major progress with placing the methods where they're supposed to be. I got a deeper understanding of the code and what the individual compoents do, so I no longer felt like I'm working with something that I don't understand. Tonight, I plan to look through the rubric and make sure my code fulfills all the level requirements so I can submit it tomorrow.

I have been able to check that the various methods in the program are functioning and even made it possible for a user to input a computer object. However, I am currently facing aproblem as the printed inventory returns as memory location instead of strng descriptions of the inventory. Professor Crouser went over this in class but I have forgotten what the approach was. I plan to google it for a bit, and, if that doesn't work, ask for help from TA hours.

<u>9/19 20:00</u>
I was able to fix the inventory display problem by googling to find a way to display an object's attributes. I plan to look through the rubric next to see what I have completed and what I'm left with.

<u> 20:13 </u>
Ihave been able to complete most parts of the rubric except the updating price section as I keep getting errors with that. Additionally, I'm not sure exactly what the naming conventions are for classes and the likes so I tried to be conventional but I'm not certain that I am. Lastly, for error messages, I'm not sure exaclty what error messages I should be displaying. For future students, I would say you should allot time to go to office hours and TA hours to get as much help on the problem as you can so that you fully understand. Apart fromt this, I found this to be a great assignment!

I was able to convert procedural code into object oriented code by initializing the right attributes and definign the right method within various classes. I have learnt that my classes can be in separate files while Icall their instances in a "main" file. This makes my code much shorter and much easier to read and understand. I enjoyed time spent working on this project with team members and by myself as well. I'm excited to do more of these.
