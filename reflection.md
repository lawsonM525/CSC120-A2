I have *seemingly* successfully created a class for the resale shop by referencing the procedural resale shop file. I wanted to start with creating a class for the computers first but I'm still not sure what exactly to reference for the attributes and methods for a computer. I'm thinking of referencing the functions in main.py especially the create_computer function as that has possible attributes. However, I would also need some methods for the computers and I'm not sure which ones to use yet.
